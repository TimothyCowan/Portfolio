"1":"There once was a man from Peru.\n Who dreamed he was eating his shoe.\n He woke up at night.\n With a terrible fright.\n To find out his dream had come true!",
"2":"My dog is quite hip.\n Except when he takes a dip.\n He looks like a fool,\n when he jumps in the pool,\n and reminds me of a sinking ship." ,
"3": "That's not my age; it's just not true.\nMy heart is young; the time just flew.\nI'm staring at this strange old face,\nAnd someone else is in my place!"
